Here are some instructions to use this tool to train for object detection in boudning boxes.

1. Assuming that it's already been downloaded, run "DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FILES=1000 label-studio start" in your terminal. This will allow you to download a ton of images onto label studio when you use it! Change the number if you need.
2. Next, in a browser, copy and paste this: "http://127.0.0.1:8080" This will open up Label Studio.
3. Create an account if you haven't already, and create a project. Set your settings, and create your labels. You can change this later.
4. Upload all of your training images. You'll have to go into your folders and select all your files at once.
5. Now you can start labeling! 

Labeling Tips:
  If you have an image that does not have an annotation in it, do NOT hit submit with nothing in it. If you do so, your number of annotations and images      will not match up. This can potentially cause your model to throw an error when you try to train it. Instead, LEAVE IT BLANK. Once you are finished         labeling, hit "Label All Tasks". Every image that you've left blank will appear. ONLY NOW WILL THE SKIP BUTTON APPEAR. Skip all of these blank images.      They will appear as skipped.

  Rotate the bounding boxes to get tighter fits.
